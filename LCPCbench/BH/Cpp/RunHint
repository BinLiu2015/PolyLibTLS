## Various choices of TLS support can be selected in file "BH_ParTLS.h"
## To run the SERIAL-COMMIT model have   "#define PAR_MODEL_SC" uncommented
## To run the IN-PLACE model comment out "#define PAR_MODEL_SC", etc.
## Choice of the hash function influences performance:
##    if "POW2_HASH_OPT"   is enabled, a hash-function of cardinality 2^14 is used
##    if "POW2_HASH_LARGE" is enabled, a hash-function of (larger) cardinality 2^20 is used
##
