## Various choices of TLS support can be selected in file "TSP_TLS.h"
## To run the SERIAL-COMMIT  keep:   "#define TLS_SC" 
## To run the IN-PLACE model keep:   "#define TLS_IP",
## To run HAND PARALLE       keep:   "#define HAND_PAR", etc.
## Choice of the hash function influences performance:
##    if "POW2_HASH_OPT"   is enabled, a hash-function of cardinality 2^17 is used
##    if "POW2_HASH_LARGE" is enabled, a hash-function of (larger) cardinality 2^19 is used
##     
## NOTE THAT TO RUN THE HAND-PARALLEL CODE YOU NEED TO KEEP ONLY     "#define HAND_PAR" selected

# EXECUTION:
#-e requires execution mode: 
# 	0 for sequential original
#   1 for sequential modified, i.e., iteration rather than recursion 
# 	2 for hand parallel, no TLS, 
# 	3 for TLS parallel
TSP -c 100000 -m -e 2
