## Various choices of TLS support can be selected in file "EM3D_TLS.h"
## To run the SERIAL-COMMIT  keep:   "#define TLS_SC" 
## To run the IN-PLACE model keep:   "#define TLS_IP",
## To run HAND PARALLE       keep:   "#define HAND_PAR", etc.
## Choice of the hash function influences performance:
##    if "POW2_HASH_OPT"   is enabled, a hash-function of cardinality 2^15 is used
##    if "POW2_HASH_LARGE" is enabled, a hash-function of (larger) cardinality 2^20 is used
##
## NOTE THAT TO RUN THE HAND-PARALLEL CODE YOU NEED TO KEEP ONLY     "#define HAND_PAR" selected
